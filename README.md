# UFOs

## Overview
Use the webpage that was built to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.  Users will be able to search based of multiple criteria at the same time.  The criteria will be date, city, state, country, and shape.

## How to Use the Webpage
Once the webpage is loaded, users will be able to filter the search based on the criteria they are looking for.  The webpage has placeholders in each field to give the user an idea of what and how to search.  Beware, that the criteria entered must be lowercase to match the dataset.  Once data is entered in the search, click enter or outside of the text box to see the results.

## Summary
As stated above, a drawback of this design is the need to use lowercase letters when entering the search criteria.  Also, the user must know specific dates, cities, and shapes to filter the data.

## Recommendations
1.  A trim function should be added to handle errors such as spacing and case sensitivity.
2.  Instead of the date needing to match exactly, filtering the data by month or year would be an easier more efficient method.
